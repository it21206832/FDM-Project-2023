**DiabetesPredict: Women's Diabetic Prediction System**

Diabetes is a widespread chronic disease that presents a significant public health challenge due to its global prevalence, particularly affecting women. 
Characterized by elevated blood glucose levels, early diagnosis and intervention are crucial for effective management and complication prevention, 
especially in female diabetic patients. The healthcare industry has increasingly turned to data mining and machine learning techniques to improve disease 
diagnosis and prediction precision. Our research aims to develop web applications using these techniques, focusing on women's diabetic prediction, to meet the urgent demand for
enhanced diabetes care while harnessing vast patient data for academic and healthcare practitioner insights.
